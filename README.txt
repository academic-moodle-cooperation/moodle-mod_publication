Publication module
===============

OVERVIEW
================================================================================
    The Publication module is used to allow students to share files with each other.

    A publication can use two different modes:
    1) Import files from an assignment
    2) Allow students to upload own files

    The publication module also provides the possibility to either
    allow files to be instantly visible to all the other students or
    the files require an approval from a teacher first.
    This gives teachers the possibility to controll which files are shared.
